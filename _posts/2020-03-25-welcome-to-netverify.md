Network verification and synthesis has emerged as an exciting area of research at the intersection of networking, programming languages, and formal methods. Motivated by the high frequency of network outages and security breaches, work in this area aims to formally prove the correctness of (some aspects of) the network, raise the level of abstraction for network design, and develop methods that are correct by construction. Researchers have developed a range of approaches that cleverly combine ideas from hardware and software verification with domain-specific insights rooted in how networks function.

The real-world impact of this line of research is undeniable despite the fact that it is relatively new. All large cloud providers are now using some form of network verification to ensure high availability for their networks. And several startups have emerged to translate research to mature technologies that can be used by a broad array of network engineers. 

One result of the newness of the area and the speed at which it is evolving, it can be difficult for researchers and practitioners not actively working in the field to make sense of it. It can be difficult to appreciate newly-developed techniques and difficult to tell how they fit into the overall picture (or, even, what is the overall picture?!). It is similarly difficult to tell which challenges have been effectively addressed and whichs ones remain open. These difficulties in turn make it harder for new researchers to enter into the area and for practitioners to judge which techniques are “shovel ready” for adoption.

Our goal with netverify.fun is to take on the challenge of making network verification and synthesis research accessible to a broader audience. We intend for it to be a living site that explains the latest research, contains expert commentary that synthesizes what may appear to be disjointed developments, and provides opinions on important open problems. 

We of course cannot succeed without your help. If you work in this area, we invite you to author blogs that explain your work to (non-networking) computer scientists and network engineers and to author opinion pieces that provide higher-level perspective on the field. If you are a network engineer, we invite you to share your challenges and views on how existing research falls short. If you are a researcher that does not work in this area, we invite you to express your frustrations with research in the area or tell us what you’d like to see covered. Our intent is for the site to be diverse and inclusive of all viewpoints.
