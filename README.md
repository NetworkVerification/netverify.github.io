Create a new markdown file with the content of your post. You can look at some examples in the `_posts` directory. The file should be named in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post`. Then submit a new PR with the blog post you want to add.

If you want to add an image to your article, simply add the image to the `assets/images/` directory and link to it in the article markdown file.
